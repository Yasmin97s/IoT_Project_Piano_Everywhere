5. When the student accepts, the lesson's notes are played and the
respective LED lights are turned on.

6. The student can choose to play using two systems:

• First system: Virtual piano, using real-time image processing techniques to
allow students to play the piano on a piece of paper. The piano keys can be
drawn or printed on the paper.

• Second system: Capacitive touch sensors.
